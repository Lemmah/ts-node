# ts-node
A small project just trying out typescript on in the backend. Using typescript to write a  nodejs app. I'm following this resource by [Adnan RahiÄ‡.](https://blog.sourcerer.io/a-crash-course-on-typescript-with-node-js-2c376285afe1)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
- Just clone this repository by typing: `git clone https://github.com/Lemmah/ts-node-api.git`
- Switch to project directory: `cd ts-node-api`
- Install packages by running `npm install`. Wait, you have to have some stuff before you get to this point. So these are:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v8.12.0 and above.
- Npm for package management, this comes with node.
Just type:
```
node -v
```
in your terminal and if its not greater than or equal to v8.12.0, you're not in big trouble, there are tons of tutorials to get up up and running with these. Just grub one then come back when done.
- TypeScript

### Installing
You will need to install the following packages globally using npm: `typescript`, `ts-node`, `concurrent`, `mocha`.
All application packages are installed by `npm install`.
Run `npm run dev` to start a development server using `ts-node`. Visit `localhost:4040`


## Running the tests

This app has no tests, it's just for learning purposes.

## Built With

* [Express](https://expressjs.com) - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.
* [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) - A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
